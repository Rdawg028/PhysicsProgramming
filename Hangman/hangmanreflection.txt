Hangman Assignment Reflection
Rowan Verdouw

1. This project wasn't too bad. I think it was just challenging
enough for an intro project but to also give us a good idea
of how python works. There isn't anything I'm specifically
proud of for this project.

2. I used this website for finding some examples of certain functions
I thought could be useful https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-string-isalpha-method/.
Daniel and I had talked during class about the project but we worked individually outside
of class. 

3. I think I deserve an A. The project works and I don't think there is any issues.
At least I didn't see any. The only special thing I added was the formatting changes that made it 
more clear in the console.
